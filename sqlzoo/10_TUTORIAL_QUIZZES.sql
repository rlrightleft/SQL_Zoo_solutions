-- Quiz 1: SELECT Quiz

-- Question 1.1: Select the code which produces this table
-- name          | population
-- --------------|-----------
-- Bahrain       | 1234571
-- Swaziland     | 1220000
-- Timor-Leste   | 1066409

SELECT name, population
FROM world
WHERE population BETWEEN 1000000 AND 1250000;

/* Reflection:
BETWEEN is inclusive, so it captures countries with populations between 1,000,000 and 1,250,000.
*/
  
-- Question 1.2: Pick the result you would obtain from this code:
    SELECT name, population
    FROM world
    WHERE name LIKE "Al%";    

-- Albania   | 3200000
-- Algeria   | 32900000

/* Reflection:
The **LIKE** operator with 'Al%' selects names starting with 'Al'. The % wildcard matches any sequence of characters.
*/

-- Question 1.3: Select the code which shows the countries that end in A or L
SELECT name 
FROM world
WHERE name LIKE '%a' 
  OR name LIKE '%l';

/* Reflection:
'%a' matches names ending with 'a', and '%l' matches names ending with 'l'. 
The **OR** operator combines both conditions.
*/
  
-- Question 1.4: Pick the result from the query
    SELECT name,length(name)
    FROM world
    WHERE length(name)=5 and region='Europe';

-- name    | length(name)
-- --------|--------------
-- Italy   | 5
-- Malta   | 5
-- Spain   | 5

/* Reflection:
LENGTH(name) counts the number of characters in the country name. 
Using AND ensures the region filter is applied alongside the name length condition.
*/
  
-- Question 1.5: Here are the first few rows of the world table:
-- name        | region      | area  | population | gdp
-- ----------- | ----------- | ----- | ---------- | ------------
-- Afghanistan | South Asia  | 652225 | 26000000   | 
-- Albania     | Europe      | 28728  | 3200000    | 6656000000
-- Algeria     | Middle East | 2400000| 32900000   | 75012000000
-- Andorra     | Europe      | 468    | 64000      | 
-- Pick the result you would obtain from this code:
    SELECT name, area*2 FROM world WHERE population = 64000;

-- Andorra | 936

/* Reflection:
**Simple arithmetic operations** such as multiplication (*) and division (/) can be used in SELECT statements.
*/
  
-- Question 1.6: Select the code that would show the countries with an area larger than 50000 and a population smaller than 10000000
SELECT name, area, population
FROM world
WHERE area > 50000 
  AND population < 10000000;

/* Reflection:
The AND operator ensures that both conditions are met â€” countries with a large area but a smaller population.
*/
  
-- Question 1.7: Select the code that shows the population density of China, Australia, Nigeria and France
SELECT name, population/area
  FROM world
 WHERE name IN ('China', 'Nigeria', 'France', 'Australia');

/* Reflection:
Dividing population by area calculates population density. 
*/

AND yr BETWEEN 1950 and 1960;

-- Question 3.3: Pick the code that shows the amount of years where no Medicine awards were given
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT yr) 
FROM nobel
WHERE yr NOT IN 
  (SELECT DISTINCT yr 
  FROM nobel 
  WHERE subject = 'Medicine');

-- Question 3.4: Select the result that would be obtained from the following code:
SELECT subject, winner FROM nobel WHERE winner LIKE 'Sir%' AND yr LIKE '196%';
-- Answer 3.4: 
  -- Medicine	| Sir John Eccles
  -- Medicine	| Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet

-- Question 3.5: Select the code which would show the year when neither a Physics or Chemistry award was given
SELECT yr

  (SELECT yr 
  FROM nobel
  WHERE subject IN ('Chemistry','Physics'));

-- Question 3.6: Select the code which shows the years when a Medicine award was given but no Peace or Literature award was
SELECT DISTINCT yr
FROM nobel
WHERE subject='Medicine' 
AND yr NOT IN
  (SELECT yr 
  FROM nobel 
  WHERE subject='Literature')
AND yr NOT IN 
  (SELECT yr 
  FROM nobel
