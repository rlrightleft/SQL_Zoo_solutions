-- Problem 1: Change the query shown so that it displays Nobel prizes for 1950.
SELECT yr, subject, winner
FROM nobel
WHERE yr = 1950;

-- Problem 2: Show who won the 1962 prize for literature.
SELECT winner
FROM nobel
WHERE yr = 1962
  AND subject = 'literature';

-- Problem 3: Show the year and subject that won 'Albert Einstein' his prize.
SELECT yr, subject
FROM nobel
WHERE winner = 'Albert Einstein';

-- Problem 4: Give the name of the 'peace' winners since the year 2000, including 2000.
SELECT winner
FROM nobel
WHERE subject = 'peace'
  AND yr >= 2000;

/* Reflection:
Using >= ensures inclusion of the boundary year 2000.
*/

-- Problem 5: Show all details (yr, subject, winner) of the literature prize winners for 1980 to 1989 inclusive.
SELECT yr, subject, winner
FROM nobel
WHERE subject = 'literature'
  AND yr BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989;

/* Reflection:
Use **BETWEEN** for an inclusive range filter.
*/

-- Problem 6: Show all details of the presidential winners: Theodore Roosevelt, Thomas Woodrow Wilson. Jimmy Carter. Barack Obama
SELECT * 
FROM nobel
WHERE winner IN ('Theodore Roosevelt', 'Thomas Woodrow Wilson', 'Jimmy Carter', 'Barack Obama');

/* Reflection:
The **IN** operator allows filtering for multiple values efficiently.
*/

-- Problem 7: Show the winners with first name John
SELECT winner
FROM nobel
WHERE winner LIKE 'John %';

-- Problem 8: Show the year, subject, and name of physics winners for 1980 together with the chemistry winners for 1984.
SELECT yr, subject, winner
FROM nobel
WHERE (subject = 'physics' AND yr = 1980)
  OR (subject = 'chemistry' AND yr = 1984);

/* Reflection:
Grouping conditions using parentheses ensures proper **OR** logic application.
*/

-- Problem 9: Show the year, subject, and name of winners for 1980 excluding chemistry and medicine
SELECT yr, subject, winner
FROM nobel
WHERE yr = 1980
  AND subject NOT IN ('chemistry', 'medicine');

/* Reflection:
The NOT IN operator filters out specific subjects.
*/

-- Problem 10: Show year, subject, and name of people who won a 'Medicine' prize in an early year (before 1910, not including 1910) together with winners of a 'Literature' prize in a later year (after 2004, including 2004)
SELECT yr, subject, winner
FROM nobel
WHERE (subject = 'Medicine' AND yr < 1910)
  OR (subject = 'Literature' AND yr >= 2004);

-- Problem 11: Find all details of the prize won by PETER GRÜNBERG
-- Non-ASCII characters: The u in his name has an umlaut. You may find this link useful https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9C#Keyboarding
SELECT *
FROM nobel
WHERE winner = 'PETER GRÜNBERG';

/* Reflection:
Handling names with special characters requires exact matching. The database distinguishes between "Ü" and "U", so an exact match is required.
*/

-- Problem 12: Find all details of the prize won by EUGENE O'NEILL
-- Escaping single quotes: You can't put a single quote in a quote string directly. You can use two single quotes within a quoted string.
SELECT *
FROM nobel
WHERE winner = 'EUGENE O''NEILL';

/* Reflection:
Putting single quotes inside a string requires using double single quotes ('').
*/

-- Problem 13: Knights in order. List the winners, year and subject where the winner starts with Sir. Show the the most recent first, then by name order.
SELECT winner, yr, subject
FROM nobel
WHERE winner LIKE 'Sir%'
ORDER BY yr DESC, 
  winner;

/* Reflection:
Sort first by descending year, then alphabetically by winner.
*/

-- Problem 14: The expression subject IN ('chemistry','physics') can be used as a value - it will be 0 or 1. Show the 1984 winners and subject ordered by subject and winner name; but list chemistry and physics last.
SELECT winner, subject
FROM nobel
WHERE yr = 1984
ORDER BY subject IN ('physics','chemistry'), 
  subject, 
  winner;

/* Reflection:
Sorting trick: subjects in ('physics', 'chemistry') are treated as boolean values (0 for false, or 1 for true).
*/
